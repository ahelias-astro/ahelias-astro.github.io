										<p>I was born in France, living on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean for most of my life.
										Back in high school, I liked maths and physics without being sure of which topic I would prefer to study.
										I studied Fundamental Physics at the Université Paris-Saclay, before specializing in Astronomy and Astrophysics
										in my last year of Master's studies at the Observatoire de Paris.</p>

										<p>After my Master's, I wanted to leave France to do something wild: a PhD in a foreign country. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented
										me from leaving France, but after 2021, I felt a great excitement to live abroad, meet different people, and explore the world.
										I am fortunate to have had research experiences with Canadian astronomers before the beginning of my PhD at Western
										University in 2022. A fun fact that I am very proud of is that since I started to do Astronomy, all of my supervisors have
										been female astronomers! I feel sincerely grateful to have worked with brillant minds, who shaped the accomplished researcher
										I am today.</p>

										<p>At Western, I had to opportunity to develop many skills outside of research. I work part-time for the Cronyn Observatory
										in the Outreach Team. We organize astronomy and stargazing events all-year round for the general public and for school groups.
										Doing this gave me more ease in public speaking.</p>
										<p>Moreover, I have also been the Chair of the Graduate Student Committee of the Canadian Astronomical Society, which advocates
										for the voices and the needs of the Canadian astro grad student community. I was deeply committed to this committee, by bringing
										new ideas and taking initiatives. Being the Chair taught me how to be a skillful leader who listens and works with their team to
										make the best of what we can do. We organized workshops for graduate students during the CASCA AGMs, as well as a brand new
										workshop series of four sessions on how to apply to astronomy post-docs (GAAP, https://cascagsc.github.io/gaap2025/),
										which were very appreciated!</p>
